## Duine Spirits

<img alt="Duine Spirit" src={duineSpiritsExample}/>

Once servant constructs of the divine, these immortal spirits now roam the continent of Runoa freely. Since the fall of the gods, many have attempted to blend in with every day society. Many continue on alone, taking up the mantle of their former masters. Others leverage their celestial gifts for their own gain, establishing powerful enterprises within the empires or lending their gifts to powerful leaders.

Duine spirits are driven by a call similar to those of their former divine master. They are drawn to those who share those similar values and causes that their god would have aligned with. A sense of mortality is particularly strong within the Duine spirits. Although they are naturally immortal, they can still die. It is often difficult for Duine Spirits to relate with others, save for the most elderly of elves, due to their unnaturally long lifespans.
