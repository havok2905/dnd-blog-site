## Dwarves

The dwarves of Runoa were the ancestral people of the underground, carving out long lived empires under the sands or within the inner walls of hollowed out mountains. Though originally one people, their cultures predominance towards isolationism caused vast schisms to form between the dwarvish people. The migration from the Habash sands to the western mountains split the dwarves forever in two, each faction adjusting to their new environments.

### Sand Dwarves

The Sand Dwarves can draw their lineage to the original dwarvish people that carved cities miles beneath the vast Habash Desert. With scarce resources under the sands, the sand dwarves' primary focus was on competition with rival clans for dominance. They hunted the scorpions that roamed the tunnels for food, crafting their exoskeleton into intricate weapons and structural material for their homes.

Having spent so much time underground, the sand dwarves have lost much of their eyesight, depending on their superb sense of touch and hearing to get by. Though Sand Dwarves today fashion their homes above ground, their sight remains darkened.

### Valley Dwarves

The Valley Dwarves were the first to leave the tunnels under the sands of Habash, venturing west towards the Scarlet Range mountains. They established tribes along the rivers that sliced between the rock, mining the mountains for material for their new cities. With an abundance of materials to work with, these dwarves began to excel at invention and engineering. They eventually abandoned the rivers and moved into their vast network of mines, returning again to the darkness that their ancestors once thrived in.
